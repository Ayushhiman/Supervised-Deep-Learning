Implemented ANN,CNN and RNN
ANN was fit on a daataset trying to predict whether someone would leave the bank. Evaluation was done using Cross validation. Tuning was done using grid search and dropout was implemented to reduce overfitting
CNN was fit on dog,cat database for classification. Two convulation and one padding layer was used. Data was genreated using generator and finally predictions were evaluated on test set.
RNN was fit on google stock price. Number of inputs used were 60. 4 LSTM layers were used with dropout regularizartion in each one of them.
